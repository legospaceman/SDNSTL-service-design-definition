How the Service Design Network St. Louis Chapter defines service design

Service Design is a human-centered design activity that places equal value on the customer experience and the business process, aiming to create quality customer experiences, and seamless service delivery. Service design helps organizations see an end-to-end, surface-to-core perspective, enabling holistic and meaningful improvements to service experiences.
